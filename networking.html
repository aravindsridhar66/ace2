        <p>One of our organizationâ€™s primary focuses is to introduce our world-class engineering students to a variety of different postgraduate opportunities, while increasing the visibility of our industry partners. Thus, if you are a corporate representative interested in establishing a partnership with ACE, we would like to invite your company to connect with the Academic Connection of Engineers at UCSD for the 2015-2016 academic year. </p>
        <p>
        Since its founding, our organization has developed a unique place in the sphere of engineering at the University of California, San Diego. As the first of its kind, the Academic Connection of Engineers ambitiously yet effortlessly brings together engineers of every engineering discipline represented at UCSD. Our unique and varied demographic inspires a diverse and realistic workspace for our undergraduates to combine their talents to approach academia and innovative project design. With our recent growth, we are seeking to introduce new companies to the talented engineering students at UCSD and within the Academic Connection of Engineers, and secure additional financial support towards events that further the promotion of our primary goal. </p>
        <p>The University of California, San Diego was recently ranked as one of the premier engineering universities both nationally and globally. We are confident that your company will greatly benefit from contact with our students, and we are excited about the career paths that may follow for our engineers. We would love to connect with you to review our sponsorship opportunities while we openly invite your company to host an information session on campus.</p>
        <p>If your company is interested in any kind of partnership or would like more information, please feel free to reach out to us directly at <a href="mailto:ACE@ucsd.edu"> ACE@ucsd.edu </a>
        </p>
