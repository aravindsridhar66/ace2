        <p>One of our organization’s primary focuses is to introduce our world-class engineering students to a variety of different postgraduate opportunities, while increasing the visibility of our industry partners. Thus, if you are a corporate representative interested in establishing a partnership with ACE, we would like to invite your company to connect with the Academic Connection of Engineers at UCSD for the 2015-2016 academic year. </p>
        <p>
        Since its founding, our organization has developed a unique place in the sphere of engineering at the University of California, San Diego. As the first of its kind, the Academic Connection of Engineers ambitiously yet effortlessly brings together engineers of every engineering discipline represented at UCSD. Our unique and varied demographic inspires a diverse and realistic workspace for our undergraduates to combine their talents to approach academia and innovative project design. With our recent growth, we are seeking to introduce new companies to the talented engineering students at UCSD and within the Academic Connection of Engineers, and secure additional financial support towards events that further the promotion of our primary goal. </p>
        <p>The University of California, San Diego was recently ranked as one of the premier engineering universities both nationally and globally. We are confident that your company will greatly benefit from contact with our students, and we are excited about the career paths that may follow for our engineers. We would love to connect with you to review our sponsorship opportunities while we openly invite your company to host an information session on campus.</p>
        <p>If your company is interested in any kind of partnership or would like more information, please feel free to reach out to us directly at <a href="mailto:ACE@ucsd.edu"> ACE@ucsd.edu </a>
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, we would love for you to fill out our interest form or connect with us on Door of Clubs:
        <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/m1IDfbKfGd" target="_blank"> http://goo.gl/forms/m1IDfbKfGd </a></p>
        <p>Our organization is expected to grow even more tremendously this year with the addition of more intensive projects and outreach; so new events will be added frequently. Interested companies will be notified of all new opportunities to interact with our diverse group of engineers.</p>
        <p>Former and current partners with the Academic Connection of Engineers:</p>
        <h1>TODO ADD PICS here</h1>
        <h1> Graduate Networking </h1>
                    
        <p>ACE is a hybrid between an academic and social organization made exclusively for engineers affiliated with the Jacobs School of Engineering. We emphasize to members, among other things, the importance of establishing connections with faculty and alumni of the engineering departments. As such, our members express interest in interacting with many different successful alumni of the UCSD engineering department. </p>

        <p>As part of our Graduate Network, you would be given access to all future networking events and conferences. On top of that, you would be given the option to be updated monthly and given the opportunity to take on a role influencing a project team as an advisor for any project in the future that may be of interest to you. With that said, you can also suggest any personal side projects you would like to pursue, and our ACE members may assemble an additional support team.</p>

        <p>ACE may still be new, but it certainly has the dynamic and diversity to develop very strong projects and connections in the future, and we hope you will come along for the ride. Your input and feedback is also extremely valuable to us, so we really hope you accept our open invitation to join our graduate network as a Jacobs alumnus.</p>

        <p>Please contact us directly at ACE@ucsd.edu if you are interested in joining our Graduate Network, or if you have any questions. *TODO add link*</p>

        <h1>Current Members of Our Graduate Network</h1> 

        <p>If you have already accepted your invitation to our Graduate Network, we would like you to join us for a series of upcoming graduate and alumni mixers this Fall, or any industry information sessions if you are interested in industry mobility. Our mixers sometimes vary in format as some are geared to establish a “think tank” culture between ACE and its Graduate Network while others are meant for enabling our undergraduates to gain insight into post graduation transitions. However, our mixers are always catered with light food and refreshments. </p>

        <p>We would love you to RSVP for our graduate and alumni mixers as early as possible, so we can plan and arrange reservations. Please use the link below to sign up for information session and/or project team updates and to RSVP to our upcoming mixers! </p>

        <p><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/C4FNHOrLtG" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/forms/C4FNHOrLtG</a></p>

        <p>As a valued member of our graduate network, we are always open to suggestions for improvement of our events, so please give us as much feedback as you want so that this is a valuable experience for you as well. </p>

        <p>Our current Alumni connections work in many different industries: </p>
